# FMOD-DSP
Basic DSP plugins for FMOD

A lot of these plugins could be improved and are sometimes limited. An example would be the delay plugin. The standalone delay plugin is limited in its application, while the delay unit built for the reverb plugin is much more robust and versatile.

I am happy with the result of these plugins as they served their purpose: to help me learn DSP programming and act as an introdution to this world. I believe with more work and study, these could become good plugins for more use than learning.
